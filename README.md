## 🚀 Usage / How it Works

This API exposes various endpoints accessible via HTTP requests. Once the server is running, you can use tools like Postman (as specified in tech stack) or curl to interact with the API.

Typical endpoints might include:
- `GET /api/resource`: Retrieve all resources.
- `GET /api/resource/:id`: Retrieve a single resource by ID.
- `POST /api/resource`: Create a new resource.
- `PUT /api/resource/:id`: Update an existing resource.
- `DELETE /api/resource/:id`: Delete a resource.
Refer to the source code for specific routes and expected request/response formats.
